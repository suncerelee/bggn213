##install.packages("igraph") and RCy3

```{r}
library(igraph)
library(RCy3)
```

Can we talk to cytoscape from R?

```{r}
cytoscapePing()
```
We cant est thigns further by  making a little sample network and sending it to cytoscape

```{r}
g <- makeSimpleIgraph()
createNetworkFromIgraph(g,"myGraph")
```

```{r}
setVisualStyle("Marquee")
```

Let's save an image from cytoscape and include it in this document

```{r}
fig <- exportImage(filename="demo_marquee", type="png", height=350)

knitr::include_graphics("./demo_marquee.png")
```

```{r}
plot(g)
```
